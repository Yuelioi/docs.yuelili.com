Those categories are:

- [Global](.././global) is for broad, commonly-used elements such as the current comp or property; the current comp time, and so on.
- [Time Conversion](.././time-conversion) holds various methods for converting time to and from various other methods.
- [Vector Math](.././vector-math) provides a suite of methods for working with vectors and arrays.
- [Random Numbers](.././random-numbers) is for generating randomness within your expression.
- [Interpolation](.././interpolation) is for converting values from one set to another, or using one set of values to drive another set of values.
- [Color Conversion](.././color-conversion) is for changing between colour modes (such as converting RGB values to HSL, or Hex values to RGB)
- [Other Math](.././other-math) is for all other assorted math– namely, converting between degrees and radians for rotation values.
