# ExtendScript Tools and Features

In addition to the specific functional modules and development tools, ExtendScript provides these tools and features:

- Global objects that support debugging and object inspection; these include the [Dollar ($) object](../dollar-object) and the [ExtendScript reflection interface](../extendscript-reflection-interface).
- A localization utility for providing user-interface string values in different languages. See [Localizing ExtendScript strings](../localizing-extendscript-strings).
- Global functions for displaying short messages in dialog boxes. See User notification dialogs.
- An object type for specifying measurement values together with their units. See [Specifying measurement values](../specifying-measurement-values).
- [Preprocessor directives](../preprocessor-directives) that allow you to include scripts in one another and specify an execution target application.
- Support for extending or overriding math and logical operator behavior on a class-by-class basis. See [Operator overloading](../operator-overloading).

ExtendScript also provides a common scripting environment for all Adobe JavaScript-enabled applications, and allows interapplication communication through scripts.

For information on these features, see [Interapplication Communication with Scripts](../../interapplication-communication/index#interapplication-communication-with-scripts).
