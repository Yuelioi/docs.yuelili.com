# Accessing Camera & Light Information

Using functions provided in the [AEGP_PFInterfaceSuite](../../aegps/aegp-suites#aegp_pfinterfacesuite1), effects can access camera and lighting information for the layer to which they're applied; see the Resizer sample.

You can also use many of the other functions from AE_GeneralPlug.h; the possibilities are vast.
