`float [] chprim_keytimes(<geometry>geometry, int prim)`

Returns an array of the time in seconds of each key in the channel primitive.

`geohandle`

A handle to the geometry to write to. Currently the only valid value is `0` or [geoself](/en/houdini-vex/geometry/geoself "Returns a handle to the current geometry."), which means the current geometry in a node. (This argument may be used in the future to allow writing to other geometries.)

`prim`

The primitive number of the channel primitive.
