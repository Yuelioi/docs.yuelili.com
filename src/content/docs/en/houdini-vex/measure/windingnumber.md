`float  windingnumber(<geometry>geometry, vector origin)`

`float  windingnumber(<geometry>geometry, vector origin, float accuracy)`

Computes the winding number of geometry around the point origin.

`float  windingnumber(<geometry>geometry, string primgroup, vector origin)`

`float  windingnumber(<geometry>geometry, string primgroup, vector origin, float accuracy)`

Computes the winding number of primitive group primgroup around the point origin.

`<geometry>`

When running in the context of a node (such as a wrangle SOP), this argument can be an integer representing the input number (starting at 0) to read the geometry from.

Alternatively, the argument can be a string specifying a geometry file (for example, a `.bgeo`) to read from. When running inside Houdini, this can be an `op:/path/to/sop` reference.

`primgroup`

Optionally compute winding number only for a subset of a mesh specified by a primitive group.

`origin`

The position in space to compute winding number.

`accuracy`

The winding number is computed only approximately. The default value 2.0 is sufficient in most situations, setting accuracy to 12.0 should yield result accurate up to floating point precision.

Returns

The winding number of geometry at a point.
