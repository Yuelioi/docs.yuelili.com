`string  strip(string value)`

`string  strip(string value, string whitespace)`

Returns a string with the leading and trailing whitespace removed. If
whitespace is provided, it is a string of characters that will be stripped.

This is also equivalent of doing both [rstrip](/en/houdini-vex/strings/rstrip "Strips trailing whitespace from a string.") and [lstrip](/en/houdini-vex/strings/lstrip "Strips leading whitespace from a string.") on a string.
