`bsdf  specular(vector dir, ...)`

Returns a specular BSDF where dir is the direction of specularity.
See [writing a PBR shader](../pbr.html) for information on BSDFs.

`vector  specular(vector nml, vector V, float roughness, ...)`

Computes specular shading.

Light inclusion/exclusion options

## light-inclusion-exclusion-options

"`categories`",
`string`
`="*"`

Specifies lights to include/exclude by their “category” tags.
This is the preferred include/exclude lights rather than pattern matching
light names with the `"lightmask"` keyword argument.

For example:

```vex
diff = diffuse(nml, "lightmask", "hero | fill");

```

See [light categories](../../render/lights.html#categories) for more information.

"`lightmask`",
`string`
`="*"`

When evaluating light and shadow shaders, objects have pre-defined light
masks. This mask is usually specified in the geometry object and
specifies a list of lights which are used to illuminate a surface or fog
shader. It is possible to override the default light mask by specifying
a “lightmask” argument.

For example:

```vex
diff = diffuse(nml, "lightmask", "light*,^light2");

```

…will cause all lights whose names begin with “light” except for a
light named “light2” to be considered for diffuse illumination.

All Houdini scoping patterns, excepting group expansion, are supported:

- `*` - wild-card match
- `?` - single character match
- `^` - exclusion operator
- `[list]` - character list match
